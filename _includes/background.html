     Until recently, I was the Product Lead at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://rated.network/home" target="_blank">Rated Labs</a> building the most robust reputation engine for machines. Moved to the bay area late Feb '25 and figuring out my next big bet.

      As a Product Manager my strengths encompass defining product vision, interfacing with clients, internal executives and my engineering team to bring the product vision to life.
      I partner with my team as a creative, strategic thinker to innovate and execute based on priorities and data. 
      I also thrive on maneuvering through project and political challenges, and most importantly, envisioning experiences that delight users. Firm practitioner of the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://sive.rs/hellyeah" target="_blank">hell yeah or no</a> philosophy.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably on CT or my iPad drawing Japanese store fronts.
      Offline, I like spending my time in the kitchen cooking something adventurous or sipping something boozy on a beach.
